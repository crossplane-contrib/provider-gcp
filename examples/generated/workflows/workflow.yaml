      # This is a sample workflow, feel free to replace it with your source code
      #
      # This workflow does the following:
      # - reads current time and date information from an external API and stores
      #   the response in CurrentDateTime variable
      # - retrieves a list of Wikipedia articles related to the day of the week
      #   from CurrentDateTime
      # - returns the list of articles as an output of the workflow
      # FYI, In terraform you need to escape the $$ or it will cause errors.
