# NOTE(hasheddan): the build submodule currently overrides XDG_CACHE_HOME in
# order to force the Helm 3 to use the .work/helm directory. This causes Go on
# Linux machines to use that directory as the build cache as well. We should
# adjust this behavior in the build submodule because it is also causing Linux
# users to duplicate their build cache, but for now we just make it easier to
# identify its location in CI so that we cache between builds.

# Special Targets

define CROSSPLANE_MAKE_HELP
Crossplane Targets:
    cobertura             Generate a coverage report for cobertura applying exclusions on generated files.
    reviewable            Ensure a PR is ready for review.
    submodules            Update the submodules, such as the common build scripts.
    run                   Run crossplane locally, out-of-cluster. Useful for development.

# The reason CROSSPLANE_MAKE_HELP is used instead of CROSSPLANE_HELP is because the crossplane
# binary will try to use CROSSPLANE_HELP if it is set, and this is for something different.
