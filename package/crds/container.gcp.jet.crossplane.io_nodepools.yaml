                      Note that if this field and auto_upgrade are both specified,
                      they will fight each other for what the node version should
                      be, so setting both is highly discouraged. While a fuzzy version
                      can be specified, it's recommended that you specify explicit
                      versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs when fuzzy versions
                      are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                      version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible
                      way.
